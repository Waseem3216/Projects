NSMIT 3D Printing Inventory App Display
Introduction:

The NSMIT 3D Printing Inventory App is a custom-built, mobile-friendly SaaS solution designed for
efficient inventory management within a university makerspace or technical department. Leveraging
Microsoft  Power  Apps  with  a  modern  FX  front-end  and  backed  by  two  SharePoint  Lists,  the  app
replaces cumbersome manual data entry with a streamlined, automated interface. Integrations with
Microsoft 365 and Azure Services ensure secure access and real-time data updates.

App Walkthrough:

App Home Screen: 

The home screen acts as the main dashboard for the NSMIT 3D Printing Inventory App. It presents two clearly defined navigation buttons: 'Materials' and 'Equipment.' The UI is optimized for touch on mobile devices, with large, accessible buttons and vibrant colors consistent with UH branding. Users can quickly begin inventory management tasks by selecting the relevant category.

Materials Inventory List: 

Upon selecting 'Materials,' users see a searchable grid of all filament and material types used for 3D
printing,  each  visually  represented  with  real  images  and  manufacturer  names.  The  search  bar
enables  fast  filtering-ideal  for  large  inventories.  Tiles  ensure  that  staff  and  students  can  instantly
recognize and select the material they need to update or audit.
Material Color Quantity Management
Selecting a material brings up a full list of all its color variations. Each color has its own quantity field
and intuitive plus/minus buttons, allowing users to increase or decrease stock. Direct editing in the
center  box  ensures  speed  and  reduces  data  entry  errors.  All  changes  are  instantly  synced  to
SharePoint in the cloud, making sure inventory is always up to date and accessible across devices.

Equipment Inventory List: 

Choosing 'Equipment' on the home screen takes users to a similar grid view, this time displaying all
printer  parts  and  critical  accessories,  such  as  extruders  and  print  beds.  Each  equipment  type  is
shown  with  a  photo  and  model  or  size  label,  making  it  easy  for  users  to  locate  the  exact  item  in
stock. The search bar offers quick filtering for large collections of equipment.

Edit Equipment Quantity: 

Clicking on an equipment item leads to a focused detail screen where the user can adjust the items
current stock. The interface includes plus/minus buttons for error-free updates, a text field for direct
number  entry,  and  displays  the  last  modified  timestamp  and  the  user  responsible  for  the  change.
This  ensures  full  accountability  and  an  auditable  change  history,  helping  manage  maintenance
cycles and reduce inventory discrepancies.

Success Confirmation: 

After any update, users see a bold, visual confirmation screen that clearly states 'SUCCESS!' along
with a green check mark. This removes ambiguity and ensures users know their changes have been
safely  saved  to  the  cloud.  Icon-based  navigation  at  the  bottom  lets  users  return  home,  log  out,  or
proceed to further actions, improving the workflow for multiple updates.
App Exit and Branding
Returning  to  the  home  screen,  users  are  provided  with  a  safe  and  clear  way  to  exit  the  app.  The
University of Houston branding is featured prominently, reinforcing institutional identity. The bottom
navigation ensures users are never lost and can end their session with confidence.
